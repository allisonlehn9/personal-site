                    Hello and welcome! My name is Allison, and I'm a student of Applied Data Science at Minerva University, an SF-based university that has allowed me to study in six different countries among an extremely international student body. 
                    I'm especially involved with the field of digital humanities, using my technical toolkit to bridge the divide between the fields of history and computer science.
                    Most importantly, I approach all of my work through a feminist, <b>emotional</b> perspective that considers the relationships I have with the data I use, the users of my products, and the people whose work and information the project builds upon.
                    As a woman in STEM, I am passionate about advocating for a shift in the way that the tech world operates via this particular perspective. 
                    I encourage intimate examinations of data, create beginner-friendly tutorials for over-complicated topics, and think critically about the biases I'm embedding in my work at every step along the way.
                    Currently, I am working on my senior Capstone project, where I advocate more directly for my emotional coding approach via the creation of and reflection upon several digital humanities projects.
                    You can check out some of these projects below!
