My name is Allison, and I'm a student of Applied Data Science at Minerva University, an SF-based university that has allowed me to study in six different countries among an extremely international student body. \r\n                    I'm especially involved with the field of digital humanities, using my technical toolkit to bridge the divide between the fields of history and computer science.\r\n                    Most importantly, I approach all of my work through a feminist, <b>emotional</b> perspective that considers the relationships I have with the data I use, the users of my products, and the people whose work and information the project builds upon.\r\n                    As a woman in STEM, I am passionate about advocating for a shift in the way that the tech world operates via this particular perspective. \r\n                    I encourage intimate examinations of data, create beginner-friendly tutorials for over-complicated topics, and think critically about the biases I'm embedding in my work at every step along the way.\r\n                    Currently, I am working on my senior Capstone project, where I advocate more directly for my emotional coding approach via the creation of and reflection upon several digital humanities projects.\r\n                    You can check out some of these projects below!\r\n                </p>\r\n

  <p>\r\n                The broader goal of the Colombia Digital History Lab (CDHL) is to create and compile public history products for scholars of Latin America, with an aim to make historical data more accessible. \r\n                In the works is the Oligarchy Project, which maps the social networks of Colombian elites according to their self-identification in the <i>Quién es quién (Who's who)</i> publication.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                The project that I'm currently working on is the Colombia Periodical Licenses Map. \r\n                Professor Robert Karl had accumulated years and years of images from annual editions of Memorias del Ministerio del Gobierno, which list all of the years' registered newspaper licenses, typically formatted like that in Figure 1.\r\n            </p>\r\n            \r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <h2>Data processing</h2>\r\n            <figure style={{display:\"flex\", flexDirection:\"column\", alignItems:\"center\", float:\"right\", width:\"500px\"}}>\r\n                <img src={fig2a} alt=\"Input data\" />\r\n                <img src={fig2b} alt=\"Output data\" />\r\n                <figcaption>Figure 2: Input image data and output text data</figcaption>\r\n            </figure>\r\n            <p>\r\n                The first step in this project is extracting the text from these images. \r\n                The most straightforward way to do this is by manually transcribing all of the information, of course, but that gets boring quickly. \r\n                Optical Character Recognition (OCR) algorithms are able to \"read\" the text from images and process them as digital text. \r\n                I had some familiarity with Google's Tesseract OCR engine and tried to use it on the data, but immediately ran into some issues. \r\n                Figure 2 shows the image that I gave to the algorithm and what I got out of it.\r\n            </p>\r\n            \r\n            <p>\r\n                Now, OCR is usually pretty messy, because computers aren't very good at doing human tasks, but this is very, very bad. \r\n                After much trial and error, I realized that the problem is the long trail of periods after every word in the table: they're being read as letters for some reason, and it's ruining everything. \r\n                When I removed them and made the images black and white, things worked much better (Figure 3).\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <figure style={{display:\"flex\", flexDirection:\"column\",

         </figure>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Even after this, there are still some spelling errors.\r\n                Here comes the central tradeoff when it comes to data cleaning: accuracy vs. speed.\r\n                There are some algorithms and techniques to catch these errors, and I implemented them to the best of my ability, but language is complex and has many exceptions, so systematically it is difficult to catch everything this way.\r\n                If I spent ages, I could catch every error manually, but even then I would still miss some mistakes, and this would also potentially drive me insane.\r\n                In some projects, my time might better be used elsewhere if I can accept a certain degree of data messiness.\r\n                In this case, however, I'm creating a translation of an archival resource, where users will be approaching the product as something close or equivalent to the primary source.\r\n                To avoid misleading information, it was important that I strive for accuracy, so I did spend extra time making sure the data was as clean as possible.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Apart from spelling errors, there are also certainly semantic errors.\r\n                For example, a key attribute in the table is the name of the director of the publication (Nombre del director).\r\n                Typically, this would be the name of an individual, but sometimes there were multiple directors of the periodical.\r\n                Furthermore, at times the \"name\" is more of a title, like \"Secretario del Gobierno,\" or the name would have an additional title alongside of it, like \"presbítero.\"\r\n                If I were the final consumer of my product, I would be able to make some purpose-driven decisions about how much of this data to represent.\r\n                However, I'm creating this product for <i>other</i> scholars of Latin America, so I intended to be as comprehensive and unambiguous as possible.\r\n                I ended up creating four columns just to encapsulate this one attribute: title (before the name, or entire title if there was no name), first name, last names, and title (after the name).\r\n                Even still, I potentially misconstrue middle names for last names, but at a certain point there is only so much I can do.\r\n                Figure 4 shows a subset of this data.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <figure style={{float:\"right\", width:\"500px\"}}>\r\n                    <img src={fig4} alt=\"Data subset: directors\" />\r\n                    <figcaption>Figure 4: Finished subset of the dataset, showing the director formatting schema</figcaption>\r\n            </figure>\r\n            \r\n            <p>\r\n                Being so involved with the digital data creation process made me especially aware of the sheer effort required to do this kind of work. \r\n                It gave me a newfound appreciation for the unthanked people behind lots of the data that's made publically available, who even do this work for free. \r\n                And while I could see the therapeutic mindlessness behind it all at first, it really did amount to tons and tons of labor.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <h2>Geocoding</h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n                The eventual goal of this project was to put the data on a map, potentially identifying some spatial trends in newspaper licenses. \r\n                Really, the number of papers almost definitely correlates with city size, but once we view this over time, we might be able to identify trends in urban development or psychological geography of the country. \r\n                Regardless, we're putting the data on a map because it presents a good platform to make the data explorable.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                This is the part I was especially excited for, because I had come fresh out of the ArcGIS User Conference feeling motivated and ready to use all of the fancy mapping techniques I had just learned. \r\n                Really, it just made me realize that I had to do some more data engineering, but I still had a good time.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                The first thing I had to do was build a locator, which would be able to map the city and place names in the data with their actual location on the map. \r\n                Professor Karl had access to a list of place names and their latitude/longitude coordinates, so this was actually pretty easy.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <h2>Mapping and visualization</h2>\r\n            <figure style={{float:\"right\", width:\"500px\"}}>\r\n                    <img src={fig5} alt=\"Default map view\" />\r\n                    <figcaption>Figure 5: Default view of multiple values being plotted at the same location (Ibagué).</figcaption>\r\n            </figure>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Once I had a sample of some of the data on a map, the question became how to visualize it in an interesting, non-misleading way.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                The first design concern I faced was how to visualize papers from the same city effectively, since these are plotted in the same location. \r\n                The default for ArcGIS's visualization for this is for each point's pop-up window to show a table with all of its data (Figure 5). \r\n                While this is functional, it doesn't make it easy to explore the information—it's impossible to tell whether a point has dozens of entries or just one.\r\n            </p>\r\n            \r\n            <p>\r\n                The first solution is to group these into clusters, as in Figure 6. \r\n                This lets us visualize the numbers, but it won't show all of the tables for each point in the cluster as in Figure 5. \r\n                Being able to visualize some of the variables within the data by cluster colors would be the more effective way to show trends.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <figure style={{float:\"right\", width:\"500px\"}}>\r\n                    <img src={fig6} alt=\"Cluster view\" />\r\n                    <figcaption>Figure 6: Cluster view</figcaption>\r\n            </figure>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Here's the problem: the dataset consists of almost entirely non-quantitative data. \r\n                Most of the variables are either categorical (types of paper, publication frequency) or simply qualitative (name of the paper, name of the director, city of publication), which aren't inherently visualizable. \r\n                The purpose of the project is to make the data more explorable, though, so I had to figure out a way to make it work.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <figure style={{float:\"right\", width:\"500px\"}}>\r\n                    <img src={fig7} alt=\"Periodical categories\" />\r\n                    <figcaption>Figure 7: Numerical representation of the periodical categories</figcaption>\r\n            </figure>\r\n            <p>\r\n                The specific variable I chose to focus on first was the type of paper. \r\n                The main summary statistic possible for categorical data like this is the mode, so I decided to visualize the most common type of paper for each cluster of points in a city. \r\n                However, the categories used to describe the papers are largely inconsistent. \r\n                For example, one paper would describe itself as “Político” and another “Política” or “Político y variedades.” \r\n                All of these papers have an element of politics in them, but if we wanted to query the number of political papers by searching for the count of “Político” labels, we wouldn't get an accurate representation of the data. \r\n                I had to operationalize the variable, splitting the categories into several main ones, allowing for multiple categories when applicable (Figure 7).\r\n            </p>\r\n            <figure style={{float:\"right\", width:\"500px\"}}>\r\n                    <img src={fig8} alt=\"Labeled clusters\" />\r\n                    <figcaption>Figure 8: Labeled clusters by category</figcaption>\r\n            </figure>\r\n            \r\n            <p>\r\n                I did this by manually identifying key words that relate the category to one of these ten main ones. \r\n                This allows me to create counts of the categories that are represented in the clusters in Figure 8. \r\n                While this does require me to make some interpretation of the data beyond what is originally represented in the clusters, it helps communicate the general trends in the variable more accurately. \r\n                By making the interpretation of this data more accessible via a relevant descriptive statistic, I am able to communicate the relationships between the variables more clearly for historical exploration.\r\n            </p>\r\n            \r\n            <p>\r\n                It is also important to mention that without the labels of the categories, it is near impossible to understand what the colors mean. \r\n                People operate based on the cognitive principle of limited information: if they had to memorize what color corresponds to what in a ten-category system, they would not be able to engage with the project very easily, and it would lose its discoverability factor.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <figure style={{float:\"right\", width:\"500px\"}}>\r\n                    <img src={fig9} alt=\"Spread points\" />\r\n                    <figcaption>Figure 9: Spread points, colored by category</figcaption>\r\n            </figure>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Another option for visualizing many points in the same location is to add a bit of spread to the points so that they cluster around the original location, but are accessible individually. \r\n                This way, each point could be selected and explored for its information. \r\n                In digitally visualizing an archive, this would be effective for a main view of all of the available points.\r\n                When selected, the pop-up window can display the name of the paper and the director's name, as well as any other relevant information. \r\n                I attempted this in Figure 9, where each square represents a paper, and its color is determined by its type. \r\n                Points with multiple colors are multi-category papers. \r\n                However, as I just mentioned, it's a bit too complicated to be intelligible.\r\n                I'm experimenting with finding a better way to visualize this concept.\r\n            </p>\r\n            \r\n            <p>\r\n                Another feature I intend to add to the project is a time slider that would allow the user to scroll between years and observe the change in the visualization over time. \r\n                I would maintain consistency in the visualization's color scheme and layout, leaving the change in numbers to be isolated and inform the user independently.\r\n            </p>\r\n

much of the actual process involved on a smaller scale. \r\n                Building a project where I am not even plausibly the prospective user has opened me up to the effort it takes to create a project that does justice to an archive in order to minimize biases transmitting from me to the next scholar. \r\n                It has reminded me that my technical toolkit is useful to the historical community, as well, which makes me feel valuable—but also appreciate with more specificity the people doing similar work in the community.\r\n            </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n

       This project is still a work in progress.\r\n                    The current draft link for the article is available <Link

    <p>\r\n                    The idea for this project emerged out of spite. \r\n                    I felt so strongly wronged by my machine learning class, as it seemed to take every opportunity to make things more difficult than they needed to be. \r\n                    I had just come out of a similar situation in my software engineering course the semester before, which is what brought me into the most intense stage of burnout I had ever experienced in my life.\r\n                    There were days where I would wake up, look at my open code notebook, and instantly burst into tears.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    There were exactly three things that helped me get through this class.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Two of them were YouTube channels: <Link href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw\" text=\"StatQuest with Josh Starmer\" /> and <Link href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@ritvikmath\" text=\"ritvikmath\" />.\r\n                    They were <i>expertly</i> able to explain every concept we were trying to learn with ease and clarity, making made me realize that learning didn't have to be emotionally challenging! \r\n                    I owe my sanity to their dedication to genuinely beginner-friendly instruction. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    The third thing that saved me was taking up crochet, and I don't care if that makes me sound like a grandma. \r\n                    My inability to grasp machine learning was making me feel like I was a bad learner, or that I had lost all of my persistence. \r\n                    However, the fact that I learned crochet from the ground up—trying and failing to make a simple heart shape at least 15 times before I got it right—without shedding a single tear made me realize that I was still fully capable of taking on a challenge. \r\n                    Whenever things would get too confusing, frustrating, or overwhelming, I would retreat into my crochet.\r\n                    Needless to say, I have gotten very, very good at it in the past year.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    I slowly eased out of my horrible burnout state over the course of the semester, and by the end, I impressed myself with how much I had actually retained once I developed one (1) singular coping mechansim. \r\n                    After a summer of not thinking about regression and classification, I was ready to enact my revenge: I was going to make machine learning easier to understand for the next generation of learners.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Along with crochet, I also started watching RuPaul's Drag Race with my roommates the same semester as I was taking machine learning. \r\n                    Months later, I put together how the overabundance of Drag Race content could work as a fun data source to explore some image data machine learning techniques, which were the ones I was most familiar with. \r\n                    It was an excellent audience to address, too—if I could explain machine learning to the average Drag Race viewer, I could explain it to anyone. \r\n                    My goal was to create multiple levels of explanation:\r\n                </p>\r\n                <ul>\r\n                    <li><b>The completely non-technical audience</b>: I explain all of the concepts at a high level, barely touching the mathematics or computer science behind it</li>\r\n                    <li><b>The beginning coder</b>: I make my process clear and understandable for someone who would like to learn along with it</li>\r\n                    <li><b>The advanced coder</b>: I link my unannotated code, in case a seasoned coder is just interested in the process I used</li>\r\n                </ul>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    My article is addressed to the first audience, but I link a Colab tutorial to my web scraping process specifically for the second audience, as well as the plain code for the third. \r\n                    I cast a wide net, and give options for a choose-your-own-adventure situation, since not everyone is at the same level. \r\n                    One of the few good things that came out of being so emotionally upended by my computer science experience is that I can remember exactly what it felt like to be a beginner, as well as what confusions I had that I didn't know the correct questions for. \r\n                    I take pride in my empathy, and I used it to make a product that is exactly what I would have wanted before I started anything.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Looking at what I've created, I feel a sense of pride that is almost equal and opposite to the absolute pit of self-loathing I found myself in just less than a year ago. \r\n                    This is where the joy is for me.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>Here are some images I've created as part of this project:</p>\r\n

     As part of a digital humanities course, I wanted to make a small-scale project aimed towards making some of this content more viewable.\r\n                    My goal was to create a dataset out of some of the information and then create some kind of <Link href=\"http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/9/1/000205/000205.html\" text=\"generous interface\" /> that encourages browsing and exploration.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Looking for an attribute to visualize, I was drawn to the glamorous covers, of course.\r\n                    Just scrolling through the archive as it exists, I thought it was fascinating to see how styles changed over time, as well as how the names of these magazines shifted according to the terminology for transgender people that was in vogue at the time of publication.\r\n                    I thought it would be fun to make this timeline more instantaneous, making it possible for a quick scrollthrough of all of the images in just a second.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    While the digitization of these magazines may be academically and personally interesting, there is a certain ethical quandary that arises when we publish potentially sensitive information like this on a digital platform.\r\n                    I've found <Link href=\"https://tararobertson.ca/2016/oob/\" text=\"Tara Robertson's discussion on this subject\" /> particularly informative.\r\n                    The models on the magazine covers consented to have their images shown in these physical magazines, but many of these were published before the internet was even a thought.\r\n                    It's highly possible that they would <i>not</i> like these images shown in this manner, and for that reason, I've been very clear in providing a mechanism for a takedown request.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    On the practical side of this project, I began by using the Python library beautifulsoup to scrape the images of the magazine covers off of the collection made available via the <Link href=\"https://archive.org/details/digitaltransgenderarchive\" text=\"Internet Archive\" />.\r\n                    You can access my code for this, as well as the link to the complete Google Sheet of
